# Sentiment_Analysis
- Distinguishing Sentiments

# Background
Twitter has become a wildly sprawling jungle of informationâ€”140 characters at a time. Somewhere between 350 million and 500 million tweets are estimated to be sent out per day. With such an explosion of data, on Twitter and elsewhere, it becomes more important than ever to tame it in some way, to concisely capture the essence of the data.

News Mood
Designed a Python script to perform a sentiment analysis of the Twitter activity of various news outlets, and to presented my findings visually.
final output provides a visualized summary of the sentiments expressed in Tweets sent out by the following news organizations: BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and New York times.

The Jupyter notebook:

- Pulls last 100 tweets from each outlet.
- Performs a sentiment analysis with the compound, positive, neutral, and negative scoring for each tweet.
- Pulls into a DataFrame the tweet's source account, its text, its date, and its compound, positive, neutral, and negative sentiment scores.
- Exports the data in the DataFrame into a CSV file.
- Saves PNG images for each plot.

Analysis completed using:
- Jupyter notebook.
- Pandas plotting libraries.
